## Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity and Cloud Protection

## 🧠 Abstract
This research paper explores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in enhancing
cybersecurity within cloud computing environments. With the rapid growth of cloud
services, traditional security mechanisms have become insufficient to address
advanced cyber threats. This study focuses on how AI and Machine Learning techniques
can be used to detect, classify, and prevent cyber attacks more effectively.

## 🎯 Research Objectives
- Analyze modern cybersecurity threats in cloud environments  
- Study the impact of Artificial Intelligence on cyber threat detection  
- Compare the performance of selected Machine Learning algorithms  
- Improve cloud security through intelligent and automated protection systems  

## 🛠️ Technologies and Concepts Used
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)  
- Machine Learning  
- Cybersecurity  
- Cloud Computing  
- Threat Detection Systems  

## 📊 Research Outcomes
The results demonstrate that AI-based models significantly improve threat detection
accuracy compared to traditional methods. Machine Learning algorithms show strong
performance in identifying malicious activities and reducing false positives in
cloud security systems.
